Day 1:

Create the boilerplate (!)
title the page "Gaming Table"
duplicate the header and footer from the landing page
Create proper semantic tags
a main tag to represent table itself
sections to represent an area that is the "Player's" cards, and an area for the "Dealer's" cards, each of which have
an h2
a list of cards, which are dealt in order (pick any cards :))
a section with
a description list of terms including "Hit", "Stand", "Split", and their defintions
a h3 containing "Player's Options"


Day 2:

this is in the table.html:
A "Player's Actions" section with an
h3 saying "Player's Actions"
buttons (should all be type:button to avoid submit behavior: plug this as an open house topic!)
A disabled "Hit" button
A "Stand" button
A "Split" button


Day 3:

add a link to a new index.css file with styles specific to this page (index.html) (after reset and common stylesheet links)
create a section with an id of hero that has 100% width, height: 30vh and
an h1 with a tagline including the word Blackjack
create a section with an id of whyUs that has 40% width
becomes 100% when the screen is 800px or smaller
includes a paragraph about why we are the best blackjack app (containg the word Why)
create a section with an id of callToAction with
becomes 100% when the screen is 800px or smaller
includes a paragraph containing the word Money
includes a button that says Start Playing

Day 5:
sketch a wireframe for 2 minutes
the header and footer needs to have a fixed position.
the nav must be a flex container
beyond this use flexbox or grid to create an awesome design. Have fun!
Make a breakpoint somewhere between 500-900px. Work in common.css so it applies to both
Make an element with a class attribute of disappearing that is only displayed above the breakpoint.
Make an element with a class attribute of mobileFeature that is only displayed below the breakpoint.
Remake the about page main content to use a grid, but you can choose your own wireframe design!

Day 6:
Add the link from google fonts
Use one font for headings, but use a different font for other elements (we will check a paragraph)
Adjust your font sizes and add some margins
Make sure h1 is 40px with a margin of 20px
#copyright needs to be 10px
Make it look good!
