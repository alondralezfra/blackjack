<!-- Day 1:
Create the boilerplate (!)
title the page "Gaming Table"
duplicate the header and footer from the landing page
Create proper semantic tags
a main tag to represent table itself
sections to represent an area that is the "Player's" cards, and an area for the "Dealer's" cards, each of which have
an h2
a list of cards, which are dealt in order (pick any cards :))
a section with
a description list of terms including "Hit", "Stand", "Split", and their defintions
a h3 containing "Player's Options"-->


<!-- Day 2:
this is in the table.html:
A "Player's Actions" section with an
h3 saying "Player's Actions"
buttons (should all be type:button to avoid submit behavior: plug this as an open house topic!)
A disabled "Hit" button
A "Stand" button
A "Split" button-->
