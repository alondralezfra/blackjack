Techwise Cohort 3 Course: Web Development Homeworks

A new branch is created for each day throughout the course. Each branch is labeled
as day-## and is an updated version of the previous day's branch version. Check out the 
final day's branch for most recent version of website.

This website was created with the purpose of learning how to use HTML. It explains what blackjack is,
the rules of blackjack, and how to play. There is an about page, a gaming table, a rules page, and more, and all pages are hyperlinked together.
